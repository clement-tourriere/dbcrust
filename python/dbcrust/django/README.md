# DBCrust Django ORM Query Analyzer

A powerful Django ORM query analyzer that detects performance issues, N+1 queries, and missing optimizations. Built on top of DBCrust's performance analysis infrastructure.

## Overview

The Django analyzer is included with DBCrust and provides enterprise-grade performance analysis for Django applications. It automatically detects common ORM anti-patterns and provides actionable recommendations.

For complete documentation, examples, and advanced usage, see the [Django Analyzer Guide](../../../docs/django-analyzer.md) in the main documentation.

## Web Dashboard

The middleware feeds a DEBUG-only web dashboard (htmx-powered, zero build step) showing every analyzed request with grades, N+1 detections, recommendations, and slow queries:

```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [..., 'dbcrust.django']
MIDDLEWARE = ['dbcrust.django.PerformanceAnalysisMiddleware', ...]

# urls.py
if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += [path('__dbcrust__/', include('dbcrust.django.urls'))]
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/__dbcrust__/`.

## Quick Start

### Installation

The Django analyzer is included with DBCrust. Make sure you have Django installed:

```bash
pip install django
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from dbcrust.django import analyzer

# Analyze your Django ORM code
with analyzer.analyze() as analysis:
    # Your Django ORM code here
    books = Book.objects.all()
    for book in books:
        print(book.author.name)  # Potential N+1 query

# Get results
results = analysis.get_results()
print(results.summary)
```

### Key Features

- **N+1 Query Detection**: Automatically detects N+1 query patterns
- **Missing Optimization Detection**: Identifies missing `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()`
- **Performance Analysis**: Integrates with DBCrust for EXPLAIN ANALYZE insights
- **Transaction Safety**: Optional transaction rollback for safe analysis
- **Detailed Recommendations**: Django-specific optimization suggestions with code examples
- **Multiple Database Support**: Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite
